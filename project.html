        <p>In this distraction blocker project we have purly used the python programming language for coding to block the websites in our computers.In 2023, the average person will spend more than 8 hours a day staring at a screen. That's more than half of our waking hours! It's no wonder that so many people feel overwhelmed and stressed out. </p>
